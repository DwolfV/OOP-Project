### Andrei
- **Top:** Communication between team members has improved, front-end and back-end started working together more to solve problems

- **Tip:** Make use of gitlab features more. The description of issues has become really good, commit messages have improved, code reviews are going well, it's just that we need to use them more.

###Alena
- **Top:** improved communication between front end and back end. Great communication within front-end

- **Tip:** Need to improve our code reviews

###Atanas
- **Top:** We improved the communication between the front and back end. We have no checkstyle warnings on development anymore.

- **Tip:** We need to work on the issues, code reviews, splitting the work between everybody evenly, and commit messages.

###Daniel
- **Top:** Checkstyle substantially improved. The tests coverage increased. Due to the limitation of not being able to meet we improved our communication "online".

- **Tip:** We still need to work on tests on the client side. Also, we need to know when to stop and change plans, cause last week the front-end wasted a lot of time on figuring it out how to work with open and close time for each room. Next time, a swifter action would be better.

###Bogdan
- **Top:** Style is a lot better and code reviewing is going smooth.  

- **Tip:** Gitlab features can be used more

###Iulia
- **Top:** we improved the style a lot, we’ve done more code reviewing than ever before, the collaboration seemed to have improved too

- **Tip:** we should improve the description of commit messages, we should fix the tool usage so that we won’t have pass with warnings anymore, we should document decisions in gitlab issues more

###Steph
- **Top:**  Reviewing code is going a lot better. We are meeting less so it is also becoming more important. checkstyle is up to date and we only need to keep it up to date with the things we push now.

- **Tip:**  We still need to do a few more tests to have that completely up to date. We also need to break up the two large controllers on the client side which we are working on right now, which will be done for next week.
