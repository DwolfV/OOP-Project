### Andrei
- **Top:** In this final week of coding the whole team worked at full power. The communication was better than ever though we did not update the gitlab issues that much. A lot of bugs were fixed and some new features were added.

- **Tip:** Even though the team has a very good understanding of the technologies used in the application, we need to make use of the gitlab feature more and document the changes that we make. Overall, we need to focus on the report and videos for the next week.

### Alena
- **Top:** I think everyone did a very good job. We worked very hard and did a lot of things.

- **Tip:** We should have finished earlier, so we have more time to test the application.

### Atanas
- **Top:** We worked really hard in the last week of the project. We also talked a lot and debugged each other's code and definitely learned a lot about java and javafx, but more importantly about working in a team and what to expect in the future. 

- **Tip:** We need to improve our use of gitlab (like issue board, merge request communication, commit messages, etc.) and need to divide our work better. because we worked all over the place, on different branches and features and it got really confusing by the end. 

### Daniel 
- **Top:** Everyone worked really hard on making the application work, there was a lot of testing and the group really put all their effort into fixing any small issues.  Moreover, the group met "online" a lot which helped us with making sure we are on track.

- **Tip:** We should have done more testing in the backend since there was a lot of small stuff that we had to change last minute, which is very stressfull. Also, there was a small feature which we forgot to do and we had to implement it quickly which led to unnecessary stress.

### Bogdan
- **Top:** This final week has been very challenging as we were on the last mile and everyone has put in a lot of effort to manage getting everything on point. The communication was grat as the team met online and the members helped eachother.

- **Tip:** The git features could have been used more. It was a bit confusing beacuse everyone was working all over the place and it was relatively confusing

### Iulia
- **Top:** The communication between the members of our group was great, we helped each other a lot and tried to do the best we could. We tried to improve ourselves every week and to include the feedbacks that we received into our work.

- **Tip:** We could have divided and scheduled our work better, fixed more deadlines with smaller but stricter things to implement so that we wouldnâ€™t have to fix errors and add features in the last minute.

### Steph
- **Top:** I think we worked very hard this week. We finalized many things and communicated a lot. We were all helping each other and and asking for help when need be.

- **Tip:** We should have planned a little better since we cut it a little short. everything worked out but it would have been nice to finish a little earlier.
