### Andrei
- **Top:** In this final week of coding the whole team worked at full power. The communication was better than ever though we did not update the gitlab issues that much. A lot of bugs were fixed and some new features were added.

- **Tip:** Even though the team has a very good understanding of the technologies used in the application, we need to make use of the gitlab feature more and document the changes that we make. Overall, we need to focus on the report and videos for the next week.

### Daniel 
- **Top:** everyone worked really hard on making the application work, there was a lot of testing and the group really put all their effort into fixing any small issues.  Moreover, the group met "online" a lot which helped us with making sure we are on track 

- **Tip:** we should have done more testing in the backend since there was a lot of small stuff that we had to change last minute, which is very stressfull. Also, there was a small feature which we forgot to do and we had to implement it quickly which led to unnecessary stress.

### Iulia
- **Top:** the communication between the members of our group was great, we helped each other a lot and tried to do the best we could. We tried to improve ourselves every week and to include the feedbacks that we received into our work.

- **Tip:** we could have divided and scheduled our work better, fixed more deadlines with smaller but stricter things to implement so that we wouldnâ€™t have to fix errors and add features in the last minute.
