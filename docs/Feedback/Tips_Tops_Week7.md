### Daniel 
- **Top:** This week we trully improved our team skills, everyone communicated better, we made sure to add new board issues to stay on task. And overall, the team seems to be going to the right direction.

- **Tip:** We will have to slightly accelerate our work on the front end side, since we are a bit behind on the retaurant feature.

### Bogdan
- **Top:** Task division was very clear this week and members tried to help each other at their best

- **Tip:** The work on certain features needs to pick up as they are a bit behind

### Steph
- **Top:** Task division went really well this week. I think we all knew what we were supposed to do and what the others were doing. We also have fixed all the checkstyles and now the pipeline passes without any warnings for both development and master.

- **Tip:** We could still use and update the issue boards a little better.
