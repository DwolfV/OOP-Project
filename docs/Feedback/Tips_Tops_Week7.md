- **Top:** We fixed all checkstyle issues, worked better as a team and divided our work more evenly. The new GUI of the application is great and we have fixed a lot of bugs. 

- **Tip:** We have to add more issues on the issue board and document our communication better. Also, some key features are still missing from the application, so we should work on that as well.

### Daniel 
- **Top:** This week we trully improved our team skills, everyone communicated better, we made sure to add new board issues to stay on task. And overall, the team seems to be going to the right direction.

- **Tip:** We will have to slightly accelerate our work on the front end side, since we are a bit behind on the retaurant feature.

### Steph
- **Top:** Task division went really well this week. I think we all knew what we were supposed to do and what the others were doing. We also have fixed all the checkstyles and now the pipeline passes without any warnings for both development and master.

- **Tip:** We could still use and update the issue boards a little better.
