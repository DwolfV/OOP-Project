## Description of project
This project is a simple reservation system for the students and staff of TU Delft. 
Being students at the Technical University of Delft has brought the team to a realization about the reservation system around the university. 
For instance, the on-campus library utilizes a reservation network which allows students to order project rooms when in need of privacy and group works. 
However, there is a certain limitation in mobility; the students need to visit the university itself to make a reservation. 
Also, TU Delft employees need to handle requests, which comes with the caveat of people being prone to making errors, also it is more costly to manage these employees. 
Therefore, we have developed a new application dedicated to reserving rooms around the university.
